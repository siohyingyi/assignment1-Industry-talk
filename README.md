The industrial talk is about the overview of ICT Jobs in Clarity Techworks. Clarity Techworks is a Fintech company based in Singapore and Malaysia. Their primary product is Rapidz Pay which is a cryptocurreccy 
payment and digital assets ecosystem. Their Singapore office was established in 2020 and their Malaysia office in Iskandar Putri was opened in 2022. The industrial talk is led by Mr. Yee Soon Tuck who is the Chief
Technology Officer of Claity Techworks and his team. From this talk, I had gained a lot of new and appropriate information for our future career planning. Firstly, I had learnt about the various
job provided in ICT sector and how ICT workers are in the front of innovation, leading change in many sections of industry. For instance, in a software development company, they provided various job position which are 
Android Developer, UI/UX Designer, QA Testing Analyst and Junior Web Developer to collaborate with each other. Each of them have different job scope and they have the responsibility to perform their own task well so that the system 
in an organisation can run smoothly. Not only that, I also learnt that if I want to be enroll in an ICT sector in the future I need to show flexible, growth-oriented mindset, curiosity,attention to detail, 
a sense of purpose, inclusiveness, consistent high academic performance and a value for learning outside the classroom. These skills are very important to us because it can help us to adapt and stay update
with the technology trend that are keep changing. 

In conclusion, after I graduate from university, I will start looking for employment. To support and contribute to our community and improve the quality of life,
I need to choose a career that is right for me. Thus, I must continually learn new skills and knowldege during my study in university to better myself.
